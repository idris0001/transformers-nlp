# Transformers & NLP

## Project Goals
This repository showcases Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects using Transformer models. Focus will be on fine-tuning pre-trained models for various NLP tasks.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Tokenization and text preprocessing
- Fine-tuning BERT, DistilBERT, or other Transformers
- NLP tasks: classification, summarization, etc.

## Structure
- `/notebooks` - Jupyter notebooks for experiments
- `/src` - Python scripts
- `/data` - Text datasets
- `/results` - Model outputs, evaluation metrics

## Future Work
- Explore more NLP tasks
- Experiment with different Transformer architectures
